//--------------METHODS-----------------------//

//structsured programming-have a problem, break it down and solve it
//ability of an object to hide its properties from the rest is encapsulation
//overriding is redefining a method with the same name but different implementations
//overloading is when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters
//polymorphism is when classes or methods can take up one or more forms
//constructor is a special method that is used to initialise an instatianted object

//Method style
/*var student = {
    name: 'Patrick',
    age: 50,
    gender: 'M'

}

console.log(student.name);*/

//another style with a constructor
/*function student(x,y,z){
    this.name = x;
    this.age = y;
    this.dob = z;
}

//creating an instance of student using the new key word
 becky = new student('becky',23,'14th March');
 console.log(becky.name);*/




/*function school(a,b){
    this.name=a,
    this.motto=b
   
}

becky = new school("mengo","akaa");
console.log(becky.name);*/


//my five objects
