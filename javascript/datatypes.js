/*
JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic 
language. Variables in JavaScript are not 
directly associated with any particular 
value type, and any variable can be assigned
 (and re-assigned) values of all types
 */
/*
 //for example
 var a = 12;//this makes `a` a number
 a = "becky";//this makes `a` a string
 a = true;//this makes `a` a boolean*/

 /*
 There are 8 datatypes as of the latest ECMAScript;
 7 of which are primitive eg 
 -boolean, null , undefined, number, bigInt, String and symbol

 and one last one is the object 
 */


 /*
 1.Boolean: Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true, and false.
 */
var x = 0;
console.log(`Boolean(x)`);
 /*
 2.null: The Null type has exactly one value: null.
 
 */

 /*
 3.undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined
 */

 /*
 4.Number. this has two inbuilt numeric types ie number and bigInt
 it has 3 symbolic values: +Infinity, -Infinity and
 Not a Number
 */

 /*
 5.BigInt. it represents integers with arbitrary precision.
 With this you can safely store and operate on large integers.
 
 */





 /*
 6.String. this represents textual data
 
 */


 /*
 
 7.Symbol.  a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property
 
 */

 
 /*
 8.object(s) ias a avalue in memory which is possily referenced by an identifer.
